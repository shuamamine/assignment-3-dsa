# assignment 3 of Data Structures and Algorithms Laboratory
1. Write a program to print the sum of the diagonal element of the M*N square matrix.
2. Write a program to store following numbers ( 1 to 9) in a matrix in spiral manner
    ```
    1 2 3
    8 9 4
    7 6 5
     ```
3. Rotate a given matrix in 90 degrees  
   input :
   ```
    1  2   3   4
    5  6   7   8
    9  10  11  12
   13  14  15  16
   ```
   output :
   ```
    13  9   5  1
    14  10  6  2
    15  11  7  3
    16  12  8  4
   ```
4. Write a program to check whether a matrix is sparse or not.
5. Given a square matrix, print the maximum length snake sequence in it. A snake 
sequence is defined as a sequence of numbers where each new number, which can 
only be located to the right or down of the current number, is either plus or minus one.
For example, we can either move right from any cell in the matrix (if that number is ±1 ) or 
move down (if that number is ±1 ). The problem is finding the longest path (snake sequence) 
through the matrix, keeping in mind that we can only move to a new cell whose value 
is concerning the current cell
6. Write a program to interchange different rows of a matrix. 
7. Write a program to reverse a string. 
8. Write a program to check whether a string is palindrome or not. 
9. Write a program to print abbreviation of a given word. (1st letter of each word) 
10. Write a program to implement searching and sorting in a given list of words
